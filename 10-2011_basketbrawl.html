					<h2>The ‘Basketbrawl’ and US-China Relations</h2>
					<img class='mainphoto'src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--WO7H17O-Ps/Toi1wGsyOmI/AAAAAAAAASU/iT8IR1IurBM/s640/georgetown-china-basketball-fight-the-chinese-blogosphere-reacts-to-the-brawl.png"/>
					<p>I’ve been very interested in the relatively recent coverage of the Georgetown-Bayi Rockets brawl. The coverage has been worth a read less as an account of the game’s events and more for the low hanging analogy that it presents for US-China relations. Sport has often been used to represent pseudo-war between states, but this was no ‘Miracle on Ice,’ not yet at least.</p>

					<p>The symbolism of the brawl is immediately evident: two teams, one representing Washington DC and the other linked to the PLA, in a state of heavy competition let the tension boil over and come to blows. Some commentators have already taken the comparison and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903639404576518412388261934.html">ran with it</a>. The link between this brawl and the tension in the current US-China relationship is not remote; the US-China relationship could suffer similar issues. Both countries are part of an increasingly competitive relationship, and, though Obama wants to use this ‘<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/26/state-of-the-union-address-obama-sputnik-moment">sputnik moment</a>’ to the advantage of both sides, the voices of election years are seldom so calm. 2012 will bring political upheaval for both the US and China, and, as politicians from both nations are under pressure to avoid being seen as a lackey of the other, tensions could very well mount.</p>

					<p>But, for all the ready comparisons, the US-China relationship is not a basketball game, and the tension is unlikely to come to blows. To make sure of this the US military has been continually pushing for improved military to military relations with China’s PLA. While 2012 may show us to have worried over nothing; the US-China mil-mil relationship of this year has been nothing short of eventful. From the visit of a JCS chairman to China’s controversial test of its new J-20 stealth fighter the events of this year have provided a grab bag of positive and negative turns. So, has the relationship improved, degraded, or stayed the same? </p>

					<h3>Status of Technology</h3>

					<p>The PRC has rapidly increased its investment the modernization of its entire armed forces. This modernization, which initially favored ground forces, has made up for lost time with its investment into the PLA Navy (PLAN) and the Air Force (PLAAF). In January, during the visit of then Secretary of Defense Gates, the Chinese J-20 stealth fighter had its first, intentionally or not, public viewed test. The timing of the test, and the subsequent response by Hu Jintao, drew questions over the civ-mil relationship within the PRC. Some saw the move as a deliberate affront to the civilian leadership and the US, while others, including Sec. Gates himself, saw the move as a less sinister failure in communication.<sup>1</sup> But beyond the intention of the test, what about the plane? The modernization of Chinese forces has been running about 20 years behind the US capability in most areas; as such, the J-20 test is nothing new. The most closely comparable US plane to the J-20, the F-22, over which the J-20 has no discernable advantage, entered a similar stage of testing in 1990. China will, no doubt, be able to spend its way to a narrower gap, but they still have ground to cover.</p>
					
					<p>The PLAN was responsible for the test of that other attention grabbing force addition: the Aircraft Carrier Varyag/Shi Lang. The increased aggressiveness of the PLAN since 2009 has been a thorn in the side of both US and regional naval interests - the addition of an aircraft carrier will prove no different. The new J-15 ‘Flying Shark,’ which is set to load the decks of this piece of power projection, <a href="http://the-diplomat.com/2011/07/24/china%E2%80%99s-two-pronged-maritime-rise/">is currently comparable to the F-14, but has the potential to match the F18</a>, which is impressive but falls a bit behind the 20 year gap. (F 14s were introduced in 1974 and F18s joined the force 10 years later) China plans to produce more carriers and force improvements, but again they are a bit behind.</p>

					<p>Under the water, China falls further behind. The PLAN recently unveiled its Yuan class submarine and has continued to produce increasingly silent diesel subs, however these forces pale in comparison to location and anti-submarine capabilities of the US fleet. Even in shallow Chinese coastal waters, the Chinese would have great difficulty competing locating and destroying US subs. Further, the Chinese reliance on low earth orbit technology for its location ability puts it at a severe disadvantage.<sup>2</sup></p>

					<p>On the other hand, the Chinese are not new to the ballistic and nuclear missile game. Having invested in ballistic missiles well prior to the current modernization, it should come as no surprise that Chinese ballistic missile technology provides the biggest threat to US naval interests. The ‘theatre denial’ capability of the DF-21D anti-ship missile placed it squarely on the brain of most US naval specialists. This missile, combined with the modernization of the Chinese nuclear force (the solid fueled DF-11 was recently revealed to Adm. Mullen during his visit) ensures that even China’s slightly lagging force is nothing to take lightly. The US military doesn’t.</p>

					<h3>Mil-Mil Contacts</h3>

					<p>In order to make sure that miscommunication does not lead to clash the US military has continued its push for mil-mil contact with China. This year, for the first time since 2007, both the US Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff visited China. During Admiral Mullen‘s July visit, no events cropped up to overshadow the trip, and, instead, he was given the first foreign access to new Yuan class submarine and the DF-11 missile – that is to say his trip was considerably smoother than that of Sec. Gates. 2011 also saw China’s first minister-level representation along side the US at the Shangri La Dialogue in Singapore.</p>

					<p>So both sides are talking, but does it matter? As outlined in PL111.84 the US goals of mil-mil contacts are: 1) to build a cooperative capacity, 2) foster institutional understanding (nuclear, space, cyber, etc.), and 3) to develop common views (on North Korea and weapon proliferation). The US and Chinese navies have built a cooperative capacity on anti-piracy for years (even if the recent Chinese military white-paper avoids mention of this), so maintaining this is an important aspect of the mil-mil relationship. However, both the mutual institutional understanding and the development of common views leave a lot to be desired.</p>

					<p>For one, as mentioned above, Chinese forces still pale in comparison to those of the US, a fact of which the Chinese are well aware. The force disparity between the two sides does not engender full transparency from the Chinese. As they see it, it isn’t the job of the underdog to inform potential competitors of their advances. So, while the US grants Chinese military officials access to training drills and naval manuals, the Chinese mostly offer scripted drills in return. Does this mean institutional understanding only moves one way? According to former US military attaches, “the U.S. military does learn something about the PLA from every visit.”<sup>3</sup> So while the information shared is not equal, perhaps it’s not realistic to ask it to be. Both sides are learning from each other and institutional understandings are being developed – ‘reciprocity as a measure of progress will only lead to disappointment’.</p>

					<p>Development of common views between the US military and the PLA, however, paints a less positive picture. Perhaps the key area of disagreement between the two sides in recent years has been North Korea. The military ties between China and North Korea have proved enduringly strong and influential within the <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/north-east-asia/china/kleine-ahlbrandt-who-shapes-chinas-north-korea-policy.aspx">Chinese policy making process</a>. While other departments have shown signs of strain over the North Korea issue, the PLA continues to support the relationship’s status quo. Pushes by the US military during its exchanges with the PLA are unlikely to change Chinese views of this relationship <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/north-east-asia/north-korea/179_shades_of_red___chinas_debate_over_north_korea.pdf">‘built on fire and blood of hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers.’</a> However, the influence of the PLA in China’s North Korean policy process means that while progress in this area is unlikely&nbsp; - at least they are barking up the correct tree.</p>

					<h3>Back to the Brawl</h3>
					
					<p>2011 has seen advances in Chinese force technology paired with increased interaction at the mil-mil level with the US. The realities of the relationship and its competition should temper any fears of the tension boiling over. However, as the political changes of 2012 draw ever closer, and the ‘season of the China threat’ begins in the US we can expect an increase in careless inflammatory rhetoric on both sides of the Pacific. So, while competition between the US and China may prove unavoidable, hopefully their communication through mil-mil contact will serve as referee – lest another brawl break out.</p>

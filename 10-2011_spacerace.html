					<h2>A Space Race of its Very Own</h2>
					<img class='mainphoto'src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aCpFVyH8_x4/TpjScciKZ7I/AAAAAAAAAS0/11JFbTRIiFY/s1600/Spacephoto.png"/>
					<p>With China’s <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/27/china-readies-its-own-space-station-module-for-launch/">recent announcement</a>, amid <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15125247">familiar fanfare</a>, that it was preparing to launch the first module of its 'go-it-alone' space station, I figured it was time to look at China's progress on its self-imposed space-race.</p>

					<p>Although China began to dabble in space during the late 1960's, it was some time before they pushed beyond the realm of satellite launches and ballistic missile tests. The Chinese National Space Bureau, as separate from the military, was not established until 1993 &ndash; nearly three decades later. As with most everything else, however, over the last several decades the Chinese space program, and its related military programs, have grown in leaps and bounds and are quickly becoming formidable players in the global scene. In a race of its own, China certainly seems to be in the lead &ndash; but when compared against previous track records its growth is put back into perspective.</p>

					<h3>The Rise of the 'Heavenly Palace'</h3>

					<p>Six years after the establishment of its Space Bureau the Chinese launched their first orbital test of their Shenzhou spacecraft, a model which would go on to carry China's first men into space. In 2003, with the launch of the Shenzhou-5, China became only the third country to have a successfully crewed space program. The subsequent Shenzhou 6 and 7 missions were manned by groups of two and three astronauts, respectively. Which brings us to today, China has not only put a man into space, it has done it three times with a total six men (some of whom even performed a space walk), all in the course of five years. In 2007, China also became only the fifth nation to orbit a spaceship around the moon. Today, rather than join the international community's combined effort, China has decided to forge ahead alone with its own space station, the Tiangong, or Heavenly Palace. China is assuredly a top country in the space industry, but how does it compare to past competitors?</p>

					<h3>US Space Race Comparisons</h3>

					<p>While a comparison between the US and Chinese space programs poses some difficulties it certainly has its uses. At a time when NASA is steadily losing its funding and has ended its own manned program a modern comparison does not seem fitting. Instead, comparisons should be made based a similar time in the US space program: NASA's rapid 1960's growth. In the five years that followed its first manned space flight the US put 16 men into orbit and performed a space walk &ndash; China had 6. It was seven years before the US reached the moon &ndash; China wants to do it in fourteen. At its height of funding in the 1960's NASA was receiving 35 billion USD per year (in current USD) &ndash; China's is somewhere around <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA457317&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf">1.4 – 2.2 billion USD per year.</a> (PDF link) The Yuan's purchasing power and the presence of previous space flight research means that such a comparison is tricky, but the Chinese space program has so far done a lot with the funding it has received.</p>

					<p>China isn't behind on everything though &ndash; in fact in some areas they have surpassed US levels of growth. China's third manned space flight (Shenzhou 7) carried 3 astronauts, a feat the US did not accomplish until Apollo 7 (7 years after its first manned flight). But perhaps the most important development the Chinese are set to accomplish is the Tiangong space station itself, which, while smaller than the US attempts, is being launched at a rate four years faster. This may not be a fair comparison but it helps to keep China's space advancement in context. China's advancements, while paling in quantity to those of 1960's NASA, are generally apace with what might be expected from such a powerful economy. That being said, 'standing on the shoulders of giants' makes previous scientific advancements considerably cheaper to emulate.</p>

					<h3>Science for Science Sake?</h3>

					<p>While not perfect, the comparison between the US and Chinese programs may go deeper than a list of time frames, accomplishments, and funding. It is more or less common knowledge that the Cold War's US-Soviet space race served two main purposes. The first, and most readily obvious, is the boost to a country's stature that came paired with doing something first &ndash; putting a satellite, a man, or a space station up in space. The second was its thinly veiled assistance to the then ongoing military arms race.</p>

					<p>Of the first reason, China certainly has upped its stature in the international community, and rightfully so &ndash; the group of countries doing manned space flight has remained a pretty exclusive club. But how does China fare on the second comparison? Are they developing their space program solely for gains in reputation, or are the military benefits as thinly veiled as before?</p>

					<p>While Chinese officials have maintained the peaceful orientation of their space program it is important to remember that the space program, as was the case with the early US space program, is run by the military. As such, there can be little doubt of 'dual-use' technological development. The Tiangong space station will presumably be employed for military experiments and surveillance, as was speculated of previous <a href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1340/1">manned missions</a>, but this, again, would be no different to space programs of the US or the USSR. So, even though China continues to develop its anti-satellite capability, alternative global positioning satellites, and military led space program, there appears to be little reason to fear a greater militarization of space by China than that of any other wealthy nation.   Following the Model</p>

					<p>The advancements of China's space program are yet another indicator as to their ascendency in the world arena. Any country that wants to be seen as a world power will want the trappings of that position. China has seen the great powers develop blue water navies, power projection capabilities, nuclear weapons, space programs, strong regional influence, and many other myriad modern examples of a nation's power. China can be seen attempting to fit that same bill, and, in most areas, is gaining on the world standard. While there is still a significant gap between US and Chinese capabilities, China has earned itself a seat at an increasingly exclusive table.</p>

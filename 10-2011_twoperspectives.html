					<h2>One Relationship, Two Perspectives</h2>
					<img class='mainphoto'src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AbXd058jT5E/Toi1-YAl-NI/AAAAAAAAASY/ApIZdgBatF4/s1600/Taiwanblogpic.png"/>
					<p>The US-China-Taiwan relationship has been ever-present in the news this past week – <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/world/asia/us-decides-against-selling-f-16s-to-taiwan.html"> the US finally agreed to sell F-16 upgrades and improved radar systems to the Taiwanese</a>, and in response the Chinese have threatened to, again, cut off military contacts between the US and China. However, while the US-Taiwan arm sale has garnered the majority of attention, it is the slightly less covered story of a Taiwanese spy that reminds us of relationship’s true depth.</p>

					<h3>Economics Will Lead the Way?</h3>

					<p>The big story of the past few years in the Taiwan-mainland relationship has been increasing levels of economic interaction between the two sides. The establishment of direct cross-strait flights,increases in the tourist industry on both sides, and ever-increasing Taiwanese investment and factory use have all provided steady indicators of the relationship’s improvements. The increase in economic interaction has been so great that it has provoked a Taiwanese fear of a ‘hollowed-out economy,’ which is over reliant on mainland factories for its welfare. This has been a political issue, but candidates on both sides of Taiwan’s upcoming presidential race understand the importance of their mainland economic contacts.</p>

					<p>In reaction the economic improvements, political responses from all sides have become increasingly metered. China’s reaction to US approval of arm sales to Taiwan has been the latest example of this trend. So far, and this very well could change, the <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2011/0927/Why-China-s-response-to-US-arms-sales-to-Taiwan-is-so-muted"> the Chinese reaction</a> has paled in comparison to its previous reactions. While official rhetoric matched the vigour of previous denouncements they’ve so far only postponed three events. Falling well short of the 5-month prohibition on relations that occurred during the Bush administration. The upcoming Taiwanese elections, the planned announcement of the PRC’s new premier, and the limited scale of Obama’s arms commitment have all played a part in PRC’s metered response, but the improvement in cross-strait economic and cultural ties no doubt played an important role.</p>

					<h3>Arms Races and Espionage</h3>

					<p>However, it’s not all been positive in the cross-strait relationship. The Washington Post’s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/in-taiwan-military-chinese-spy-stirs-unease/2011/09/20/gIQA9aYm2K_story.html"> recounting</a> of Maj. Gen. Lo Hsien-che’s spying charge and conviction reminds us that a heart of suspicion and military competition still beats below a surface of improved economic exchanges. The presence of spies in the US-Taiwan-China relationship is not much of a surprise – odds are good that each side of the triangle spies on the others – but we are not often privvy to details of this dark underbelly. Back in January of this year Lo was arrested and charged after an alleged 6 years on the PRC payroll. Since Lo was linked to the communications and electronics section of the Taiwanese military he had access to numerous Taiwanese defensive secrets, including the $1 Billion Po ShengLockheed-Martin designed <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12401472"> defence system</a>. The PRC’s gathered intelligence on these systems could pose a tremendous threat to Taiwan’s self-defence.</p>

					<p>Indeed all of this stems from the question of Taiwan’s statehood. The lack of a political solution has meant that the military competition and suspicion of an earlier era has continued unabated, if a bit more difficult to detect. Coupled with espionage is an ongoing arms competition, one that Taiwan is that they are losing. In the end the arms race could be potentially more damaging for the island. The new US supplied radar system should be able to detect the PRC J-20 stealth fighter, but the PRC’s <a href="http://the-diplomat.com/2011/07/24/china%E2%80%99s-two-pronged-maritime-rise/2/"> new J-15 fighter</a> , when properly outfitted, is nearing an area where it can compete even with Taiwan’s newly updated F-16C/D. Taiwan has stretched what its purchases to the fullest, but even the hardened runways of the ROC hard program may be no match for the new wave of PRC planes and intelligence gathering.</p>
					
					<p>As the cross-strait relationship enjoys ever-strengthening economic ties, it is important for us to remember the issue that remains at the core of the relationship – statehood. Without addressing the Taiwan’s international status the relationship can never become genuinely pleasant. Ultimately, no matter how close economic and cultural links become the potential for existential military conflict ensures that tension continues to boil just below the surface. A relationship where someone will sell you something one minute and sell you out the next can only be stable for so long.</p>
